## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Start Controller Application
**Procedure:**
1. Connect to Raspberry Pi directly or via SSH
2. Navigate to controller application directory
3. Start the controller application with debug logging enabled
4. Wait for initialization complete message (typically 2-3 seconds)

**Expected Output:**
```
Controller Application Started
Listening for PS3 controller input on [port]
Ready for input
```

**Actual Output:**
```
[Record actual output here]
```

**Notes/Issues:** [If any]

---

### Step 2: Connect PS3 Controller
**Procedure:**
1. Press start button on PS3 controller
2. Observe connection confirmation on Raspberry Pi
3. Verify controller connection status in application logs

**Expected Output:**
```
PS3 Controller Connected
```

**Actual Output:**
```
[Record actual output here]
```

**Notes/Issues:** [If any]

---

### Step 3: Test Analog Stick Input
**Procedure:**
1. Move left analog stick to full left position
2. Record decoded value in application
3. Repeat for: right, up, down, diagonals

**Expected Output:**
- Left stick: X=0x00, Y=0x80
- Each direction shows correct analog value decoding

**Actual Output:**
```
[Record actual output here]
```

**Notes/Issues:** [If any]

---

### Step 4: Test Button Inputs
**Procedure:**
1. Press each button sequentially: Cross, Circle, Triangle, Square
2. Record decoded button press in application logs
3. Verify CAN payload generated for each button
4. Test L1, L2, R1, R2 shoulder buttons

**Button Test Results:**

| Button | Decoded Value | CAN ID | CAN Payload | Status |
|--------|---------------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Cross (X) | ___ | ___ | ___ | PASS/FAIL |
| Circle (O) | ___ | ___ | ___ | PASS/FAIL |
| Triangle (Δ) | ___ | ___ | ___ | PASS/FAIL |
| Square (□) | ___ | ___ | ___ | PASS/FAIL |
| L1 | ___ | ___ | ___ | PASS/FAIL |
| L2 | ___ | ___ | ___ | PASS/FAIL |
| R1 | ___ | ___ | ___ | PASS/FAIL |
| R2 | ___ | ___ | ___ | PASS/FAIL |

### Step 5: Stress Test - Rapid Input
**Procedure:**
1. Perform rapid button presses (10 presses/second for 10 seconds)
2. Monitor for dropped inputs or errors
4. Verify no buffer overflow or crash occurs

**Expected Output:**
- All inputs captured without loss

**Actual Output:**
```
[Record measurements here]
```

**Notes/Issues:** [If any]

---

### Step 6: Stop Test & Verify Clean Shutdown
**Procedure:**
1. Disconnect PS3 controller
2. Stop controller application gracefully

**Expected Output:**
```
PS3 Controller Disconnected
Controller Application Shutting Down
All resources released
```

**Actual Output:**
```
[Record actual output here]
```

**Notes/Issues:** [If any]
