## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Verify CAN Bus Physical Connectivity
**Procedure:**
1. Measure voltage between CAN_H and CAN_L on both ends
2. Verify CAN_H and CAN_L not shorted together
3. Check termination resistor resistance (should be ~120Ω)
4. Verify all connectors are seated properly

**Expected Output:**
```
CAN_H: ~2.5V at rest
CAN_L: ~2.5V at rest
Termination: ~60Ω (two 120Ω in parallel)
```

**Actual Output:**
```

2. Verify interface is up: `ip link show can1`

**Expected Output:**
```
can1: <NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 16 qdisc mq state UP mode DEFAULT group 33
    link/can  promiscuity 0
    RX packets: 0  TX packets: 0
```

**Actual Output:**

RX Interrupt: Enabled
Echo Mode: Active
TX Ready
```

**Actual Output:**
```

### Step 4: Single Message Transmission - Rpi → STM32
**Procedure:**
1. Send test message from Raspberry Pi to STM32
2. Use cansend tool: `cansend can1 123#AABBCCDDEE`
3. Capture on logic analyzer (if available)
4. Verify message received on STM32 and echoed back

**Expected Output:**
```
CAN message transmitted with ID 0x123
Payload: AA BB CC DD EE
STM32 received message successfully
STM32 echoed message back to Raspberry Pi
No CAN errors reported
```

**Actual Output:**
```
[Record actual output here]
```

### Step 5: Bidirectional Communication Test - Rpi → STM32 → Rpi
**Procedure:**
1. Compile and run the C++ communication test program on Raspberry Pi
2. The program will:
   - Send 1000 CAN messages with ID 0x123
   - Each message contains a timestamp (8 bytes, packed uint64_t in microseconds)
   - STM32 receives each message via CAN interrupt and immediately echoes it back
   - Raspberry Pi receives the echo and verifies communication is working
   - 100ms delay between each iteration
3. Monitor the test output for successful message exchanges
4. Record any timeouts or errors

**Test Execution:**
```bash
# Compile the C++ communication test code
c++ -o can_communication_test can_latency_receive_test.cpp

# Run the communication test
./can_communication_test > communication_results

# Test will output values for each iteration
# Or "TIMEOUT" if no response within 100ms
# Or "RX_ERROR" if response format is incorrect
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Successful message exchanges with minimal timeouts or errors
Majority of iterations complete successfully
```

**Actual Output:**
```
