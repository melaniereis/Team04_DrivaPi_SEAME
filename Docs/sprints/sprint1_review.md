## Specific Technical Feedback

### 🔴 Clarification: Real-Time vs. Low-Latency

**Director's Observation:**
During the presentation, the team stated that Rust enables "real-time control." The director drew attention to the difference between:

- **Real-Time**: Systems with deterministic guarantees and hard/soft deadlines (requires RTOS, PREEMPT_RT patches, WCET analysis)
- **Low-Latency**: Fast systems but without strict temporal guarantees

**Recommendation:**
Use correct terminology: the current system implements **low-latency control** (sub-millisecond), not real-time stricto sensu. To be truly real-time, the following would be necessary:
- PREEMPT_RT patches in the Linux kernel
- Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis
- Deterministic deadline guarantees

**Action for next sprints:** Adjust technical language in presentations and documentation.

---

### 🟡 Recommendation: Cross-Compilation for Qt

**Context:**
The team compiled the Qt application directly on the Raspberry Pi.

**Facilitators' Feedback:**
Strongly recommended adopting **cross-compilation** to:
- **Drastically reduce build times** (compiling on an x86_64 PC is significantly faster)
- **Preserve Raspberry Pi resources** during development
- **Align with industrial practices** in embedded development
- **Facilitate future CI/CD integration**

**Action for Sprint 2:**
Configure cross-compilation toolchain (aarch64-linux-gnu) in the development environment.
---

### 🔴 Alert: Rust on STM32 Microcontroller

**Critical Observation:**
Facilitators expressed **significant concern** regarding the application of Rust on the STM32 microcontroller:

**Reasons:**
1. **C/C++ is the absolute standard** for microcontroller programming in the automotive industry
2. **High complexity** of implementing Rust in bare-metal or RTOS environments
3. **Limited ecosystem** compared to official ST HAL/LL libraries in C
4. **Doubts about feasibility** in systems with limited resources (memory, processing)
5. **Debugging and tooling support** much more mature in C/C++

**Facilitators' Recommendation:**
Seriously consider using **C or C++** for the microcontroller, reserving Rust for high-level code on the Raspberry Pi.

**Necessary Discussion:**
The team must evaluate:
- Trade-offs between innovation (Rust) vs. pragmatism (C/C++)
- Availability of libraries and HAL in Rust for STM32U585
- Debugging and maintenance complexity
- Alignment with project requirements and deadlines

---

### 📚 Global Recommendation: Mono-repo vs. Multi-repo

**Guidance for all teams:**
Study and understand repository management approaches used in the industry:

**Mono-repo:**
- Advantages: Atomic cross-component commits, simplified refactoring, unified tooling
- Disadvantages: Scales poorly for giant projects, complex granular access
- Examples: Google, Meta

**Multi-repo:**
- Advantages: Clear separation of responsibilities, independent CI/CD per component
- Disadvantages: Complex dependency management, synchronization between repos
- Examples: Most of the automotive industry

**Action:**
Consciously choose the approach that best suits the DrivaPi project, technically justifying the decision.

## Team Sprint Review Methodology

The team implemented an **innovative and humanized approach** to the sprint review, focusing on **peer recognition**:

### Implemented Format
Instead of each member talking about themselves, **each member spoke about another colleague**, highlighting:

1. ✅ **Importance of individual contribution** in the sprint
2. ✅ **How that member adds value to the team**
3. ✅ **Suggested areas for improvement** in a constructive manner

### Results
- **All members were highly praised** by colleagues
- Recognition that **each member was essential** for the sprint's success
- Creation of an environment of **positive and constructive feedback**
- Strengthening of **team cohesion and morale**
